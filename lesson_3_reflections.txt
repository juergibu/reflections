When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When making changes on more than one computer.
	When I want to make my repository available for others.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Many commits togehter might represent a complete change to a new working version
